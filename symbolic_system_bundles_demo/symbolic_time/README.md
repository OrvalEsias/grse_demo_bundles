# **SYMBOLIC TIME — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Symbolic Time** branch defines how symbolic systems behave **across time**, how meaning cycles recur, how symbolic pulses propagate, and how temporal structures shape the evolution of characters, worlds, and narrative.

If Symbolic Energy is the *force* of meaning, and Symbolic Ecology is the *environment*, then **Symbolic Time is the dimension through which meaning unfolds**.

Symbolic Time models:

* Recurring cycles of meaning
* Temporal escalation and symbolic buildup
* Pulse-driven world and character changes
* Timescales controlling symbolic evolution speed
* Time crystals — stable, repeating symbolic patterns
* Thresholds that trigger transformations when crossed over time

Symbolic Time is essential for long-form simulations, emergent narrative arcs, AGI symbolic cognition, and any system where **meaning changes through rhythmic or recursive temporal behavior**.

## 3. Purpose of the Symbolic Time Branch

Symbolic Time answers the question:

> **“How does meaning move, repeat, escalate, or transform across time?”**

It provides:

* Rhythms of symbolic intensification and decline
* Cyclic behavior that links symbolic states across steps
* Structural tempo for narrative and symbolic growth
* Rules for symbolic recurrence, decay, and buildup
* Temporal containers and scaffolding for long-range simulation

Symbolic Time transforms symbolic systems from *static* to **dynamic**, enabling:

* Character arcs that evolve through rhythms and cycles
* Worlds that shift through symbolic seasons
* Narrative beats tied to symbolic thresholds
* Recursive symbolic loops with identifiable temporal phases

---

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Symbolic Cycles**

* Phase tracking (rise, peak, decay, rest)
* Recurring symbolic motifs
* Oscillation patterns across characters, world, or zones

### **Symbolic Pulses**

* Burst-like symbolic energy propagation
* Triggering transformation events
* Rhythmic narrative beats

### **Temporal Mapping**

* Linking symbolic conditions to temporal structures
* Predictive temporal modeling
* Multi-timescale symbolic behavior

### **Time Crystals**

* Stable symbolic patterns repeating over time
* Recursive symbolic stability cycles
* Structural anchors for narrative and evolution

### **Timescale Management**

* Slow symbolic change vs. rapid symbolic mutation
* Macro/micro symbolic clocks
* Variable symbolic tempo control

### **Threshold Tracking**

* Accumulation-over-time behavior
* Trigger conditions based on symbolic history
* Rupture events caused by symbolic buildup

Together, these make time a **first-class symbolic dimension**, not merely a step counter.

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Narrative** → determines pacing, beats, arcs, turning points
* **Symbolic Recursion** → loops depend on temporal closure patterns
* **Symbolic Energy** → pulses and cycles amplify or diminish energy states
* **Symbolic Ecology** → density shifts follow temporal rhythms
* **Character Branch** → character development follows symbolic seasons

### **Receives Input From:**

* World tick rate, zone states
* Character symbolic history
* Energy/density changes throughout simulation
* Items influencing temporal flow or symbolic pulses

Symbolic Time is the **spine** of long-form symbolic evolution.
