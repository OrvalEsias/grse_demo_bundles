# SYMBOLIC CORE — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **Symbolic Core** is the foundational layer of the symbolic engine.
It defines the essential data structures, transformation utilities, meaning-mapping logic, and topology models that all other symbolic bundles build upon.

This branch establishes the *grammatical substrate* of the system — how symbols are represented, combined, interpreted, and propagated through recursive processes. All higher symbolic cognition, recursion, narrative expression, and symbolic energetics depend on the primitives and operations defined here.

The Symbolic Core is designed for:

* Symbolic AI research
* Cognitive simulation
* Generative narrative systems
* Recursive meaning engines
* Any system requiring structured symbolic representation and transformation

It provides the stable, extensible backbone for the entire Symbolic Branch.

## 2. Bundle Contents

The bundle includes the following modules:

| File                     | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **symbolic_engine.py**   | Core symbolic processor; orchestrates transformations, propagation, and evaluation. |
| **symbolic_topology.py** | Defines symbolic space, adjacency rules, and recursive topology shaping.            |
| **symbolic_types.py**    | Base symbolic types (glyphs, forms, patterns, structures).                          |

## 3. Purpose of the Symbolic Core

This bundle provides the **infrastructure of meaning** within the system.
Its responsibilities include:

* Representing symbols as structured, manipulable objects
* Providing consistent rules for symbolic combination
* Enabling propagation of symbolic states
* Modeling symbolic “space” and adjacency
* Supporting recursive meaning-making
* Serving as the base layer for higher symbolic cognition

In essence, **the Symbolic Core expresses how meaning behaves**.

Everything in the Symbolic Branch — cognition, recursion, narrative, energy, ecology, and time — is built on top of the primitives defined here.

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Symbol Representation**

* Glyphs, forms, composite structures
* Hierarchical symbolic identities
* Pattern-level grouping and decomposition

### **Symbolic Processing**

* Conversion and normalization
* Combination, splitting, and reduction operations
* Topology-aware symbolic behaviors

### **Topology & Structure**

* Meaning adjacency rules
* Symbolic “distance” relationships
* Recursive structural shaping

### **Utility Framework**

* Deep inspection tools
* Validity checking
* Symbolic pattern alignment
* Transformation helpers

### **Integration with Higher Layers**

The Core enables:

* Narrative symbolism
* Recursive symbolic evolution
* Symbolic-energy modeling
* Symbolic-time transformations
* Cognitive symbolic reasoning

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Upstream (depends on Symbolic Core):**

* **Symbolic Cognition**
* **Symbolic Recursion**
* **Symbolic Narrative**
* **Symbolic Time**
* **Symbolic Energy**
* **Symbolic Ecology**

All of these branches extend the functionality defined here.

### **Cross-Branch Interactions:**

* **Character Branch:** uses symbolic structures for meaning, identity, archetypes
* **World Branch:** uses symbolic topology for environmental symbolic fields
* **Item Branch:** items use symbolic signatures and transformations

---

## 6. Running the Symbolic Core

The bundle provides four main entrypoints:

### **`loader.py`**

Loads symbolic modules and returns initialized systems.

### **`harness.py`**

Runs diagnostic tests and core functionality verifications.

### **`demo.py`**

Provides a minimal demonstration of symbolic transformation or evaluation.

### **`full_run` (if present in root)**

Used by higher-level integration to test all symbolic branches together.

To run all symbolic bundles at once, use the **root-level**:

```
run_all.py
```

## 7. Licensing

The Symbolic Core and all included files are provided **as-is**.
Commercial or research use, redistribution, and integration into proprietary systems require explicit written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Symbolic AI research
* Cognitive simulation systems
* Procedural narrative generation
* Complex stateful symbolic environments
* Game engines requiring meaning mechanics
* Recursive symbolic modeling in AGI research
* Experimental media and immersive storytelling
