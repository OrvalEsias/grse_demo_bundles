# **SYMBOLIC ENERGY — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Symbolic Energy** branch models the *intensity, flow, pressure, and gradients* of symbolic activity across characters, items, and world zones. If the Symbolic Core defines the grammar of meaning, and Symbolic Ecology defines the environmental behavior of meaning, then **Symbolic Energy defines the physics of meaning**.

Symbolic Energy represents:

* How symbols accumulate power
* How symbolic charge moves through systems
* How symbolic pressure shapes behavior
* How symbolic thresholds trigger transformations
* How world density influences character evolution

This branch is essential for any simulation where **symbolic states behave dynamically**, fueling recursion, mutation, narrative tension, and emergent symbolic behavior.

## 3. Purpose of the Symbolic Energy Branch

Symbolic Energy answers the question:

> **“How strong is a meaning signal, and how does it flow?”**

It governs:

* Symbolic accumulation & depletion
* Symbolic pressure between entities or zones
* Energy-based transformation triggers
* Symbolic feedback loops with ecology & recursion
* Symbolic stress patterns, rupture points, and harmonics

Symbolic Energy is a foundational layer for:

* **Symbolic recursion** (intensity shapes loops)
* **Symbolic narrative** (energy spikes create turning points)
* **Symbolic cognition** (energy weight influences interpretation)
* **Character evolution** (energy thresholds unlock traits)
* **World symbolic dynamics** (zones generate or absorb symbolic force)

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Energy Calculation & Flow**

* Symbolic charge computation
* Energy flow between entities and world zones
* Energy decay, transfer, and accumulation

### **Symbolic Pressure & Thresholds**

* Pressure gradients determining symbolic tension
* Threshold-triggered transformations
* Rupture events and symbolic overload

### **Energy Fields & Zones**

* Density-based field modeling
* Zone-specific influences
* Local symbolic gravity and repulsion

### **Energy Topology**

* Field adjacency and symbolic pathways
* Gradient-based clustering and movement
* Integration with symbolic topology maps

### **Tracking & Historical Logging**

* Time-series symbolic energy logs
* Spikes, drops, patterns, drift
* Cycle-level summaries

Together these systems model symbolic energy as a **living, dynamic substrate**.

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Recursion** → Energy intensity shapes loop closure & recursion amplitude
* **Symbolic Ecology** → Energy contributes to density, trait shifts, and resonance
* **Symbolic Narrative** → Energy spikes produce narrative beats & symbolic turning points
* **Character Branch** → Characters evolve at high symbolic energy states

### **Receives Input From:**

* World density and symbolic topology
* Item symbolic-energy effects
* Character symbolic markers and states

Symbolic Energy interacts with *all* symbolic systems because it defines the **force** behind symbolic behavior.
