# SYMBOLIC ECOLOGY — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **Symbolic Ecology** bundle models how symbols behave in an *environmental*, *evolutionary*, and *ecological* context.
Where the Symbolic Core defines the grammar of meaning, Symbolic Ecology defines **how meaning behaves as an ecosystem**—how symbolic density, markers, traits, and topologies evolve and interact over time across characters, items, and zones.

This branch is responsible for:

* Symbolic “ecosystems” and environmental symbolic density
* Evolution of traits through ecological conditions
* Topological tracking of symbolic markers across time
* Detection of emergent symbolic behavior
* Ecological resonance between characters and world states

Symbolic Ecology forms the substrate layer for **Symbolic Evolution, Recursion, and Narrative Emergence**, enabling meaning to mutate, cluster, propagate, and feed back into character and world behavior.

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **symbolic_evolution.py**         | Applies symbolic evolution logic — trait gain, thresholds, world-delta changes.  |
| **symbolic_topology_tracker.py**  | Tracks symbolic markers, clusters, density logs, and topological field behavior. |
| **symbolic_topology_upgrades.py** | Provides cluster-expansion logic for symbolic markers as ecosystems grow.        |
| **symbolic_trait_emergence.py**   | Computes emergent traits based on symbolic markers and ecological conditions.    |
| **trait_dependant.py**            | Applies trait-dependent item behaviors conditioned on ecological traits.         |
| **trait_gate.py**                 | Trait-gating logic to restrict access or activation based on ecological traits.  |
| **symbolic_ecology_engine.py**    | Ecological resonance engine — evaluates symbol-density effects on characters.    |

These modules collectively define a full symbolic-ecological layer supporting higher symbolic cognition and narrative expression.

## 3. Purpose of the Symbolic Ecology Branch

Symbolic Ecology answers the question:

> **“What happens when symbols act like living organisms in an ecosystem?”**

The branch models:

* **Ecological adaptation** of symbolic traits
* **Environmental influence** on symbolic identity
* **Clustering and propagation** of symbolic motifs
* **Topological evolution** of symbolic fields
* **Feedback loops** between symbolic density and character transformation

Symbolic Ecology is what allows the system to simulate the *living behavior of meaning*.

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Ecological Symbolic Evolution**

* Threshold-based trait evolution
* Symbolic energy and density effects
* Environmental world-delta propagation

### **Topology Tracking**

* Marker appearance tracking
* Trait/symbol clustering
* Symbolic density logs
* Overlap detection & field mapping

### **Emergent Trait Logic**

* Environment-driven trait acquisition
* Loss or transformation of traits
* Symbol→trait mappings

### **Ecological Resonance**

* Characters gain or lose traits based on symbolic density

### **Trait Gating & Dependency**

* Trait-locked item interactions
* Environmental trait requirements
* Activation effects tied to ecological states

### **Cluster Expansion**

* Expansion of symbolic clusters as motifs spread

Together these systems allow meaning to “self-organize” into ecological patterns.

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Cognition** → Uses ecological signals for meaning inference
* **Symbolic Recursion** → Recurrence detection based on topology
* **Symbolic Narrative** → Environmental motifs become narrative drivers
* **Character Branch** → Characters mutate through ecological symbolic forces
* **World Branch** → Environmental symbolic density shapes zone behavior

### **Receives Input From:**

* Items (symbolic evolution triggers)
* World states (density, markers, zones)
* Characters (traits, symbolic markers)

Symbolic Ecology is the “bridge layer” where world, character, item, and symbolic systems interact.

## 6. Running the Symbolic Ecology Branch

To integrate and test this bundle:

### **1. Evolution Engine**

```
apply_symbolic_evolution(item, character_state, world_state, log)
```

### **2. Topology Tracker**

```
log_symbol_use(marker, step)
update_symbol_clusters(name, traits)
track_world_density(world)
get_topological_summary()
```

### **3. Emergent Traits**

```
emergent_traits_from_context(character, world)
```

### **4. Ecological Resonance**

```
apply_ecological_resonance(world_state, character)
```

### **5. Trait Gating**

```
check_trait_gate(character, item)
apply_trait_gate_effects(character, world, item, log)
```

If your branch includes a harness or loader (optional), these are used in the same pattern as the Symbolic Core branch.

## 7. Licensing

This bundle is provided **as-is**.
Commercial, research, or derivative use requires explicit permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Symbolic ecosystems in games
* Ecological worldbuilding for narrative AI
* Emergent meaning simulations
* Character evolution modeling
* Symbolic density–based world mechanics
* AGI symbolic research
* Dynamic ecological storytelling

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

Symbolic Ecology is intended for creative, exploratory, and research uses.
It should not be used to:

* Model or manipulate real-world psychological ecosystems
* Engineer behavioral influence systems
* Simulate people without their consent

Meaning should be treated ethically, just as living systems are.
