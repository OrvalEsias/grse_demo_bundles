# narrative_reaction_pack — README

## Purpose

The **narrative_reaction_pack** enables items to respond to narrative conditions, emotional states, archetypal triggers, or symbolic signals. It bridges the gap between narrative logic and item behavior, transforming items into participants in the story rather than static tools.

Items can:

* react to character arcs
* shift behavior during symbolic or emotional events
* activate or transform based on narrative milestones
* express alignment with archetypes or story themes

This pack is essential for systems where narrative meaning shapes the world.

# Integration

### Depends on:

* **core_pack** — item data structure
* **conditional_logic_pack** — gating narrative-driven actions

### Interacts with:

* **symbolic_intelligence_pack** — symbolic meaning processing
* **core_runtime_pack** — runtime modification of item state
* **item_crafting** — narrative-influenced crafting paths
* **living_items_pack** — story-driven evolution or personality change
* **world_interaction_pack** — narrative events affecting zones
* **targeting_recommender_pack** — narrative-weighted action choices

This pack allows items to become symbolic actors within the overarching story.
