# living_items_pack — README

## Purpose

The **living_items_pack** enables items to function as *autonomous, adaptive entities* capable of growth, decision-making, and symbolic evolution. This bundle transforms items from static objects into dynamic participants within the simulation.

Living items can:

* sense context
* make decisions
* evolve traits
* store memory
* respond to narrative or symbolic signals
* express preferences or behavioral patterns

This pack is a key differentiator of the ErbeSystem — bridging the gap between objects, agents, and symbolic entities.

# Core Responsibilities

* Provide autonomous behavior loops for items
* Manage item memory, preference shaping, and long-term evolution
* Evaluate context (world, characters, symbolic density, narrative cues)
* Trigger self-initiated actions or transformations
* Coordinate symbolic resonance changes over time
* Support personality-like or archetypal item profiles
* Enable recursive development across simulation ticks

---

# Included Systems

* **Autonomous decision engine** for items
* **Internal memory structure** (episodic, symbolic, or functional)
* **Evolution rules** (trait growth, fusion, resonance drift)
* **Behavior modules** (curiosity, alignment, reactive patterns)
* **Symbolic self-models** enabling reflective item behavior
* **Stage-based metamorphosis** for multi-form items
* **Event listeners** for world, narrative, or symbolic triggers

---

# Integration

### Depends on:

* **core_pack** for item structure
* **conditional_logic_pack** for gating decisions

### Interacts with:

* **core_runtime_pack** — executes item actions
* **generator_pack** — seeds initial states for living items
* **item_crafting** — transforms items into evolvable forms
* **symbolic_intelligence_pack** — deeper cognition and symbolic reasoning
* **narrative_reaction_pack** — story-driven evolution cues
* **world_interaction_pack** — environmental shaping of item behavior
* **targeting_recommender_pack** — pruning or prioritizing actions

Living items are fully embedded in both symbolic physics and world dynamics.

# Typical Use Cases

* Intelligent artifacts, relics, or magical tools
* Items that grow with a character or world state
* Symbolic-alignment experiments in AI research
* Evolutionary ecosystems of items
* Narrative or mythic systems involving living objects
* Autonomous helpers, familiars, or companions
