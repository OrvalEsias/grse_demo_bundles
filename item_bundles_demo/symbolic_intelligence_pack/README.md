# symbolic_intelligence_pack — README

## Purpose

The **symbolic_intelligence_pack** grants items the ability to reason symbolically, interpret meaning structures, analyze situational context, and generate intelligent responses or actions. It is the cognitive layer of the Item Branch and dramatically expands what items can *understand* and *do*.

Where the **living_items_pack** enables autonomy and evolution, this pack enables **symbolic cognition**, symbolic inference, and deep contextual awareness.

This is one of the most advanced packs in the entire system.

# Core Responsibilities

* Process symbolic cues (resonance, density, mirrors, archetypes)
* Generate meaning-aligned item behaviors
* Support symbolic reasoning pathways
* Interpret narrative, emotional, or world-state signals
* Influence item evolution through symbolic insight
* Connect item behavior to the broader symbolic engine
* Provide abstract reasoning hooks for higher-level systems

---

# Included Systems

* **Symbolic reasoning engine**
* **Meaning-mapping utilities** (situational → symbolic)
* **Symbolic perception layer** for items
* **Archetype and pattern recognition functions**
* **Symbolic behavior generator**
* **Integration layer for symbolic physics and narrative meaning**

---

# Integration

### Depends on:

* **core_pack** — item schema and symbolic fields
* **conditional_logic_pack** — to confirm symbolic eligibility

### Interacts deeply with:

* **living_items_pack** — for autonomous symbolic decision-making
* **narrative_reaction_pack** — to resolve narrative-symbolic meaning
* **core_runtime_pack** — for executing symbolic-derived actions
* **world_interaction_pack** — to apply symbolic effects to zones
* **generator_pack** — for symbolic-aligned item generation
* **targeting_recommender_pack** — for meaning-based target selection

This pack is central to unlocking symbolic behavior across the item ecosystem.

# Typical Use Cases

* Items that adapt to symbolic environments
* Artifacts that reveal deeper meaning or respond to archetypes
* AI research into symbolic cognition using item entities
* Symbolic puzzles, rituals, or mythic interactions
* Deep world simulations where meaning acts as physics
* Tools that evolve purpose through interpretive reasoning

---

# Why This Pack Matters

Most item systems — even advanced ones — stop at mechanics or stats.
The **symbolic_intelligence_pack** transforms items into:

* interpretive agents
* symbolic participants
* meaning-responsive entities

It is foundational for the ErbeSystem’s symbolic uniqueness.
