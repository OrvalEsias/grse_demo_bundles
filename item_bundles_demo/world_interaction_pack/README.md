# world_interaction_pack — README

## Purpose

The **world_interaction_pack** connects items directly to the world layer, enabling them to influence zones, respond to environmental conditions, and participate in large-scale symbolic or physical transformations.

This pack allows items to:

* modify world or zone states
* react to environmental forces
* trigger symbolic or physical effects across the map
* interpret world conditions such as density, resonance, noise, and topology
* serve as catalysts for environmental evolution or disruption

It forms the bridge between items and the world simulation.

# Core Responsibilities

* Process item-to-world interactions
* Apply item effects to zones or world structures
* Evaluate world conditions before activating item abilities
* Translate symbolic physics into item responses
* Coordinate with world evolution or symbolic triggers
* Provide hooks for environmental storytelling or dynamic world-building

---

# Included Systems

* **Zone effect dispatcher**
* **World-state reader** (density, resonance, noise, symbolic vectors)
* **Environmental reaction logic**
* **Symbolic-environmental translation layer**
* **Topology-aware interaction utilities**
* **Multi-zone propagation mechanics**

---

# Integration

### Depends on:

* **core_pack** — base item structure
* **conditional_logic_pack** — gating environmental actions

### Interacts deeply with:

* **core_runtime_pack** — executing item effects
* **symbolic_intelligence_pack** — symbolic interpretation of world dynamics
* **living_items_pack** — environmental awareness and adaptive behavior
* **narrative_reaction_pack** — narrative/world event alignment
* **generator_pack** — world-aware item creation templates
* **targeting_recommender_pack** — evaluating environmental target suitability

This pack makes the Item Branch fully world-aware and world-responsive.

# Typical Use Cases

* Items that alter zones (light, shadow, corruption, growth, symbolic pulses)
* Tools that interact with symbolic world physics
* Environmental puzzles or dynamic terrain systems
* Items whose power depends on world-state conditions
* Research environments exploring symbol-to-environment coupling
* World-building frameworks with recursive item/world influence

---

# Why This Pack Matters

Without this bundle, items remain isolated from the world layer.
The world_interaction_pack empowers:

* environmental storytelling
* symbolic feedback loops
* dynamic recursive ecosystems
* emergent behavior driven by items that shape (and are shaped by) their surroundings

It completes the loop between items → world → items.
