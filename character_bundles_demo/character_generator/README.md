# CHARACTER_GENERATOR — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_generator** bundle provides a complete system for creating new characters procedurally. This includes:

* simple template-based character creation
* multi-layer symbolic and psychological generation
* advanced recursive and trait-driven character construction

This bundle is responsible for producing *initial character state* in a way that is consistent with your symbolic system, cognition layers, and narrative or environmental context. It supports everything from lightweight prototypes to fully realized symbolic agents.

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_generator** bundle establishes the foundation for **new character creation** across your system. It:

* constructs characters from scratch
* configures symbolic, cognitive, and energetic layers
* initializes traits, memory structures, and internal states
* provides multiple levels of complexity for different use cases

The advanced generator allows a character to begin with a mature internal structure instead of developing it gradually.

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Multi-Stage Character Creation**

* Basic to advanced generation options
* Modular and scalable design

### **Symbolic Initialization**

* Characters begin with symbolic meaning structures
* Archetypal and narrative potentials can be seeded

### **Trait and Cognition Setup**

* Creates trait maps, conflict structures, fusion potential
* Initializes belief, emotional, and cognitive layers

### **Identity and Evolution Readiness**

* Characters are immediately compatible with evolution, alignment, and psychodynamic systems

### **Flexible Generator Tiers**

* *character_generator.py* → lite mode
* *character_generator_2.py* → moderate depth
* *character_generator_3.py* → deeply structured characters
* *character_generator_advanced.py* → full symbolic recursive characters

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Bundles

This bundle interacts directly with:

* **character_core** → initializes perception, observer, persona layers
* **character_cognition_and_traits** → builds the cognitive and trait infrastructure
* **character_symbolic** → seeds symbolic structures
* **character_energy** → initializes PWA and environmental responsiveness
* **character_evolution** → creates characters ready to transform

It is the entry point into the full symbolic character lifecycle.

---

## 6. Running This Bundle

Execution tools include:

* `loader.py` — initializes generator modules
* `harness.py` — structured validation
* `full_run.py` — executes the entire build pipeline
* `demo.py` and `demo_init.py` — simple examples

Compatible with the root-level `run_all.py` orchestrator.
