# CHARACTER_ALIGNMENT — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_alignment** bundle governs how characters relate to themselves, to others, and to the symbolic structures shaping their world. It integrates relational logic, identity dynamics, group affinity, and trait-level harmonization into a unified system. Together, these modules determine how characters:

* align with or oppose one another
* evolve their relationships over time
* manage internal conflicts
* synchronize with symbolic or narrative forces
* form lasting alliances, rivalries, or group affiliations

This bundle models *relational cognition* — the way identity shifts through interaction, memory, group pressures, and symbolic resonance.

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_alignment** bundle defines the *shifting relational field* between characters. It answers:

* Who is aligned with whom?
* Why do relationships change?
* How do symbolic events alter interpersonal dynamics?
* What internal conflicts drive characters closer or apart?

This system provides the foundation for **coalitions, rivalries, transformations, betrayals, reconciliations**, and emergent narrative structures.

---

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Relational State Management**

* Tracks relationship levels
* Applies affection, aversion, loyalty, rivalry, and neutrality
* Updates states based on interactions or symbolic triggers

### **Identity Evolution**

* Monitors micro‑shifts in identity
* Detects long‑arc transformations
* Models how identity affects alignment and vice versa

### **Group Alignment Logic**

* Computes faction or group affinity
* Incorporates shared values, goals, or symbolic resonance

### **Trait Conflict + Trait Fusion**

* Internal contradictions weaken alignment
* Fused traits stabilize or strengthen relational identity

### **Symbolic Affinity Mapping**

* Aligns characters based on symbolic meaning structures
* Enables mythic or archetypal relational patterns

## 5. Interaction with Other Bundles

This bundle interacts closely with:

* **character_emotion** → emotional states influence alignment
* **character_memory** → relational memory modifies affinity
* **character_intent** → intent shifts based on alliances or conflicts
* **character_symbolic** → symbolic motifs strengthen or weaken bonds
* **character_self** → identity changes propagate through alignment

The full expressive power appears when combined with these layers.

---

## 6. Running This Bundle

Execution tools include:

* `loader.py` — initializes all systems
* `harness.py` — controlled relational testing
* `full_run.py` — executes complete alignment cycles
* `demo.py` and `demo_init.py` — quick demonstrations

This bundle is compatible with the root-level `run_all.py` orchestrator.
