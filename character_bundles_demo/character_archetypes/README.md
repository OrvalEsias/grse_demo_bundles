# CHARACTER_ARCHETYPES — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_archetypes** bundle implements the deep mythic structures that shape a character’s inner world. These modules model the universal symbolic patterns—such as anima, shadow, poles of identity, and axial meaning structures—that influence how a character interprets reality, forms motivations, and undergoes psychological transformation.

Archetypes define **why** a character behaves the way they do on a mythic level, offering:

* symbolic polarity (light/shadow, anima/animus)
* deep motivational structures
* recurring mythic patterns
* identity axes that guide transformation arcs

This bundle is essential for characters experiencing symbolic crises, archetypal conflict, or narrative metamorphosis.

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_archetypes** bundle creates a mythic foundation for characters, giving them:

* unconscious drives
* symbolic conflicts
* thematic destinies or trajectories
* forces of tension that pull them toward transformation

This allows characters to behave in ways that feel deeper, more psychologically grounded, and more connected to universal stories.

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Archetypal Polarity Modeling**

* Tracks active archetypes and their balance
* Builds tension between light/shadow, conscious/unconscious

### **Shadow Resolution Mechanisms**

* Identifies symbolic projections and internal contradictions
* Guides characters toward integration or fragmentation

### **Axis of Identity**

* Defines a character’s mythic axis (purpose, direction, destiny)
* Shapes meaning-making and narrative trajectory

### **Symbolic Metamorphosis**

* Models transformational thresholds
* Drives evolution when archetypal pressure is high

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Bundles

This bundle interacts directly with:

* **character_psychodynamics** ? emotional and unconscious pattern modeling
* **character_evolution** ? transformation gating and symbolic evolution
* **character_symbolic** ? meaning-structure integration
* **character_memory** ? mythic memory and symbolic recall

Together, these create psychologically rich and narratively coherent characters.

---

## 6. Running This Bundle

Execution files:

* `loader.py` — initializes archetypal structures
* `full_run.py` — performs the archetype evaluation pass
* `harness.py` — controlled testing interface
* `demo.py` — minimal demonstration of archetype behavior
* `demo_init.py` — sets up symbolic/archetypal defaults

Use root-level `run_all.py` to run the full Character Branch.
