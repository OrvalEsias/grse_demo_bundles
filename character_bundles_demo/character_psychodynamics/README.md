# character_psychodynamics — README

## Purpose

The **character_psychodynamics** bundle models the *inner life* of a character: emotions, affect shifts, subpersonas, symbolic climate, internal boundaries, and the deep structures that govern psychological change.

This bundle provides the machinery for:

* emotional weighting and modulation
* affective color of perception and intent
* formation and activation of subpersonas
* symbolic internal weather patterns ("psyche weather")
* psychodynamic hooks and triggers
* boundary alarms for psychic overload or rupture
* structural axes that stabilize or destabilize the psyche

In short: **this is the living psyche of the character.** It governs how they feel, shift, react, internalize, and transform.

## Included Capabilities

### **1. Affect Engine**

**File:** `affect_engine.py`
Manages:

* valence, arousal, dominance shifts
* emotional tone of decision making
* affective influence on perception and symbol interpretation

This provides the base layer of *felt experience*.

---

### **2. Emotion Engine**

**File:** `emotion_engine.py`
Models emotions as dynamic systems influenced by:

* memory
* traits
* symbolic markers
* narrative context

Supports:

* emotion decay
* amplification by symbolic events
* conflict between simultaneous emotional states

---

### **3. Psyche Weather (Symbolic Climate System)**

**File:** `psyche_weather.py`
Simulates the character’s inner atmosphere:

* turbulence (conflict, overwhelm)
* clarity (focus, calm)
* storms (trauma activation)
* fronts (emotion surges)

This is a symbolic representation of internal conditions.

---

### **4. Psychodynamic Hooks**

**File:** `psyche_hooks.py`
Defines:

* triggers
* attachment points
* symbolic sensitivities
* resonance hooks that connect events to emotional or symbolic meaning

These hooks determine *why* something affects the character.

---

### **5. Subpersona System**

**Files:**

* `subpersona_engine.py`
* `subpersona_transformer.py`

Implements:

* multiple inner agents
* persona masks
* shadow activation
* symbolic transformations of inner roles

Allows characters to shift into alternate internal modes.

---

### **6. Axis Sphere (Psyche Topology)**

**File:** `axis_sphere.py`
Represents the structural geometry of the psyche:

* stabilizing axes
* destabilization vectors
* orientation of internal subsystems

Useful for symbolic cognition and mythic-structure modeling.

---

### **7. Boundary Alarm System**

**File:** `boundary_alarm.py`
Detects:

* emotional overload
* symbolic threats
* identity boundary rupture
* subpersona collapse

This provides a protective layer to prevent runaway internal instability.

---

## Execution and Packaging Files

Included for testing and integration:

* `loader.py`
* `harness.py`
* `full_run.py`
* `demo.py`
* `demo_init.py`
* `__init__.py`

All compatible with root-level `run_all.py`.

## How This Bundle Interacts With Others

The psychodynamics layer integrates deeply with:

* **character_memory** — emotions and subpersonas depend on memory traces
* **character_intent** — affect and emotion weight intent formation
* **character_symbolic** — hooks and weather respond to symbolic events
* **character_self** — subpersonas and boundaries influence identity
* **character_agi** — psychodynamic patterns inform recursive modeling

It can be licensed independently but reaches full capability when combined with the broader Character Branch.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

* emotionally rich simulations
* symbolic or mythic character transformations
* emergent psychological behavior
* internal conflict modeling
* recursive narrative character arcs

---

## Licensing

This bundle is provided **as-is**.
Commercial, research, or redistributive use requires written permission.

## Summary

The **character_psychodynamics** bundle gives characters an *inner world*—one that shifts, reacts, and transforms across time. It provides:

* emotion systems
* affect layers
* dynamic inner climate
* subpersona management
* symbolic resonance hooks
* boundary protection
* psychological topology

This is the heart of a character’s inner life and essential for advanced cognition and narrative evolution.
