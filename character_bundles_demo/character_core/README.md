# CHARACTER_CORE — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_core** bundle defines the foundational systems that all other character modules build upon. These engines govern how a character:

* perceives the world
* interprets meaning
* maintains internal identity layers
* updates features and traits
* generates personas
* receives symbolic or narrative insight

This is the **baseline architecture** that makes a character function as an integrated cognitive, perceptual, and behavioral system.

The modules in this bundle serve as the *spine* of the Character Branch, enabling all higher cognition, alignment, symbolic processing, and AGI evolution.

| **character_feature_engine.py** | Core engine handling character attributes, internal states, and modular feature updates               |
| **observer_engine.py**          | Implements internal observer logic—how a character internally monitors itself and external conditions |
| **perception_engine.py**        | Manages perceptual processing, world interpretation, and input transformation                         |
| **persona_engine.py**           | Generates and updates persona layers (roles, masks, behavioral modes)                                 |
| **prophecy_engine.py**          | Supplies symbolic insights, narrative cues, or predictive guidance                                    |
| **demo.py**                     | Minimal demonstration of core character operations                                                    |
| **demo_init.py**                | Initializes core state for demo execution                                                             |
| **full_run.py**                 | Executes the entire character core pipeline end-to-end                                                |
| **harness.py**                  | Test harness for controlled evaluation of core character logic                                        |
| **loader.py**                   | Initializes and loads all core components                                                             |

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_core** bundle establishes the essential functionality required for:

* perception
* introspection
* adaptation
* behavioral structuring
* contextual awareness
* symbolic interpretation (via prophecy)

It ensures every character has a consistent foundation before higher-order systems—such as cognition, traits, archetypes, AGI reasoning, or alignment—act upon it.

---

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Baseline Cognitive Architecture**

* Perception, observation, internal feedback loops

### **Feature & Attribute Management**

* Central point for updating character state
* Integration point for features derived from traits, memory, or symbolic events

### **Persona Modeling**

* Generates persona layers
* Ensures characters exhibit recognizable behavioral modes

### **Prophetic / Symbolic Guidance**

* Provides symbolic cues or future-oriented prompts
* Supports narrative integration and mythic structure

## 5. Interaction with Other Bundles

The **character_core** bundle provides the scaffolding used by:

* **character_cognition_and_traits** → draws from perception, observer cycles, and persona layers
* **character_archetypes** → interacts with persona and perception engines for symbolic expression
* **character_psychodynamics** → relies on perception and observer feedback
* **character_agi** → depends heavily on observer cycles and feature/state processing

All other character bundles assume the functionality defined here.

---

## 6. Running This Bundle

Execution tools include:

* `loader.py` — initializes the core systems
* `harness.py` — controlled evaluation of baseline logic
* `full_run.py` — executes the unified character core pipeline
* `demo.py` and `demo_init.py` — provide simple usage examples

Compatible with the root-level `run_all.py` orchestrator.

This bundle is provided **as-is**.
Any commercial, research, or redistributive use requires written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Foundation for all character simulation systems
* Narrative or agent-based modeling requiring consistent behavior
* Symbolic reasoning or psychological simulation frameworks
* Research into perception, internal modeling, or persona formation

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

This module should only be used for creative or controlled research contexts.
It must not be used for psychological inference or manipulation of real individuals.
