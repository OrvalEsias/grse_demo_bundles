# CHARACTER_MEMORY — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_memory** bundle provides the full memory architecture for symbolic characters. It defines how characters:

* form, store, and recall memories
* inherit echoes from past versions of themselves or other characters
* consolidate experiences into long-term structures
* link memories symbolically and psychologically
* integrate memory into traits, cognition, and evolution

This system is responsible for creating *continuity*, *identity*, and *personal history* within your characters. It enables characters to behave not only based on the present moment, but based on accumulated meaning and experience.

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_memory** bundle provides the internal narrative backbone of a character. It:

* enables continuity over time
* supports emotional and symbolic resonance
* informs beliefs, traits, and identity
* provides the basis for transformation arcs
* captures meaningful experiences and integrates them into the psyche

Without memory, no character can evolve, interpret meaning, or maintain a coherent identity.

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Episodic and Symbolic Memory Formation**

* Records events, emotions, and symbolic cues
* Connects lived experiences to internal meaning structures

### **Memory Echo and Inheritance**

* Characters receive echoes from past states or ancestors
* Enables multi-generational or recursive story structures

### **Consolidation and Forgetting**

* Distills experiences into long-term knowledge
* Integrates memory into traits, beliefs, and identity

### **Memory–Trait Integration**

* Traits absorb experiential information
* Memory shapes character tendencies and stability

### **Memory Access and Visualization**

* Tools for debugging memory systems
* Panels and logs for introspection during development

## 5. Interaction with Other Bundles

The memory bundle integrates deeply with:

* **character_cognition_and_traits** → beliefs and emotions depend on memory
* **character_psychodynamics** → unconscious patterns are shaped by memory echoes
* **character_evolution** → transformation arcs require memory continuity
* **character_symbolic** → memory provides meaning inputs for symbolic processing
* **character_agi** → recursive agents rely on memory for self-modeling

Memory is one of the most interconnected systems in the entire Character Branch.

---

## 6. Running This Bundle

Execution tools include:

* `loader.py` — initializes memory systems
* `harness.py` — structured memory tests
* `full_run.py` — runs the complete memory pipeline
* `demo.py` and `demo_init.py` — simple examples showing memory flow

Compatible with the root-level `run_all.py` orchestrator.

This bundle is provided **as-is**.
Any commercial, research, or redistributive use requires written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Character continuity systems
* Symbolic or mythological memory modeling
* Multi-generational narratives
* Research on memory, recursion, or narrative cognition
