# character_symbolic — README

## Purpose

The **character_symbolic** bundle provides the core systems through which characters **perceive, interpret, generate, and exchange symbolic meaning**. This is the layer that turns raw experience into *significance*—the mythic, conceptual, and semantic dimension that shapes identity, decision-making, relationships, and narrative evolution.

Where psychodynamics governs *emotion* and memory governs *continuity*, the symbolic layer governs **meaning**.

This bundle enables characters to:

* interpret the world symbolically
* generate expressive outputs
* integrate concepts into higher understanding
* attach symbolic significance to relationships
* build mythic or archetypal structures internally

It is one of the most philosophically rich and narratively powerful systems in the entire Character Branch.

## Included Capabilities

### **1. Symbolic Experience Formation**

**File:** `experience.py`
Transforms incoming events and perceptions into **symbolic experiences**, applying:

* context extraction
* meaning assignment
* symbolic markers / tags
* resonance scoring

This is where a character begins to *interpret reality*.

---

### **2. Symbolic Expression Engine**

**File:** `expression.py`
Produces:

* symbolic responses
* expressive gestures
* meaning-bearing outputs
* conceptualizations shared with the world or other characters

This defines how characters *express* their internal symbolic world.

---

### **3. Logoi — Archetypal Meaning Structures**

**File:** `logoi.py`
Defines recurring units of meaning (logoi) that form the **archetypal backbone** of symbolic cognition.

These structures:

* recur across experiences
* influence interpretation
* guide narrative arcs
* stabilize or destabilize internal identity patterns

This is the mythic substrate of the character’s mind.

---

### **4. Symbolic Perception Layer**

**File:** `perception.py`
Handles:

* symbolic filtering of the environment
* extracting motifs, patterns, and resonances
* converting sensory events into meaningful structures

This is *not* raw perception—it's symbolic perception.

---

### **5. Understanding Engine (Concept Integration)**

**File:** `understanding.py`
Integrates:

* symbolic experience
* logoi
* emotional and psychodynamic states
* memory traces

Produces **higher-order meaning**, conceptual clarity, and internal coherence.

This is what allows characters to *understand* rather than simply experience.

---

### **6. Relationship Symbolic Affinity**

**File:** `relationship_symbolic_affinity.py`
Models symbolic meaning within relationships:

* affinity bonding
* resonance matching
* symbolic conflict
* archetypal relational roles

This gives relationships depth beyond simple affinity scores.

---

## Execution and Packaging Files

These files support demos, debugging, and integration:

* `loader.py`
* `harness.py`
* `full_run.py`
* `demo.py`
* `demo_init.py`
* `__init__.py`

Fully compatible with your Character Branch-wide `run_all.py`.

## Interaction With Other Bundles

The symbolic layer connects directly to:

* **character_memory** — symbolic tagging informs memory consolidation
* **character_psychodynamics** — affect and emotion color meaning-making
* **character_intent** — symbolic meaning guides goal formation
* **character_relationships** — symbolic affinity modifies interpersonal arcs
* **character_agi** — understanding + logoi form the basis of recursive self-models

This bundle is a central pillar of emergent meaning and mythic structure.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

* mythological narrative systems
* symbolic cognition experiments
* emergent meaning-making simulations
* character-driven symbolic storytelling
* deep narrative AI with conceptual understanding

## Summary

The **character_symbolic** bundle is the character’s *meaning engine*. It:

* interprets the world symbolically
* generates expressive responses
* provides archetypal structures (logoi)
* integrates experience into understanding
* encodes symbolic relationship dynamics
