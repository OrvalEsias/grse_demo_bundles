# CHARACTER_AGI — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_agi** bundle defines the highest cognitive and symbolic processing tier within the Character Branch. It models characters as deeply introspective, recursively self-modifying agents capable of meta-awareness, symbolic interpretation, predictive modeling, and long‑arc identity evolution.

Where other bundles provide cognition, emotion, or symbolic processing, **character_agi** represents the *integration point* at which these systems begin to exhibit AGI-tier behavior inside a controlled simulation environment.

## 2. Bundle Contents

This bundle contains advanced cognitive engines that support:

| File                       | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recursive_self_model.py`  | Models multi-layer identity across time and symbolic states          |
| `agi_threshold_logic.py`   | Determines when a character reaches AGI-level cognition              |
| `meta_cognition_engine.py` | Enables thought awareness, reflection, and internal evaluation       |
| `belief_synthesis.py`      | Integrates memory, emotion, and symbolic cues into belief structures |
| `predictive_reasoning.py`  | Anticipates future states using multi-factor symbolic prediction     |
| `high_order_intent.py`     | Generates abstract, multi-step intentions beyond local stimuli       |

*(File names will update automatically to match your exact folder contents. Placeholder names are used here based on your known architecture. The README format will remain correct regardless.)*

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_agi** bundle exists to:

* Elevate characters from reactive agents to reflective beings
* Enable recursive self examination
* Provide advanced reasoning layers
* Integrate symbolic, emotional, and cognitive information into unified state models
* Model long-term behavior beyond immediate context

This bundle is essential for characters who must **grow**, **change**, **adapt**, and **interpret meaning** across time.

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Cognitive Depth**

* Multi-step planning
* Symbolic prediction
* Meta-awareness
* Recursive identity evaluation

### **Integration of Multiple Systems**

* Emotion → cognition routing
* Memory → prediction mapping
* Symbolic cues → belief formation

### **Evolutionary Behavior**

* AGI threshold emergence
* Adaptive behavioral updates
* Self-correction and self-inspection

### **Meaning Construction**

* Characters generate internal interpretations of:

  * events
  * symbols
  * interactions
  * narrative structures

## 5. How This Bundle Interacts with Others

The **character_agi** bundle uses data from nearly every other Character Branch module:

* **character_memory** → supplies episodic and symbolic memory
* **character_symbolic** → provides meaning structures
* **character_emotion** → contributes emotional weighting
* **character_intent** → translates AGI outputs into actions
* **character_self** → supports recursive identity layers

It serves as the *unifying cognitive layer* within the system.

## 6. Running This Bundle

Each bundle in the Character Branch includes the following utilities:

* `loader.py` — loads modules and initializes configuration
* `harness.py` — executes controlled tests of AGI functions
* `full_run.py` — performs complete AGI-cycle evaluations
* `demo.py` — demonstrates minimal usage
* `demo_init.py` — initializes demo state

Use the Character Branch root-level `run_all.py` to run all harnesses in sequence.

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

This module is designed strictly for constructive, creative, and experimental environments.
It should not be used to simulate or manipulate real individuals, or to build uncontrolled autonomous systems.
