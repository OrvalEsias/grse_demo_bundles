# character_symbolic_cognition — README

## Purpose

The **character_symbolic_cognition** bundle provides the *higher-order symbolic reasoning systems* that allow characters to not only interpret meaning (symbolic layer) but to **think with it**, **transform it**, **model themselves through it**, and **emerge into new traits or identities**.

This bundle is the bridge between:

* **symbolic meaning** (previous layer), and
* **AGI-tier recursive cognition** (next layer).

It is one of the most structurally important bundles in the Character Branch—representing a character’s ability to:

* reinterpret symbolic experience
* propagate symbolic information inward or outward
* form symbolic memories distinct from episodic memory
* develop emergent traits from symbolic resonance
* step through reasoning processes symbolically
* model themselves symbolically (“symbolic self-awareness”)

This is *where symbols become thought*.

## Included Capabilities

### **1. Symbolic Diffusion System**

**File:** `symbolic_diffusion.py`
Models how symbolic meaning spreads through a character’s internal systems:

* diffusion across traits
* symbolic energy propagation
* resonance-based activation of latent symbolic structures
* influence of symbolic meaning on cognition and emotion

This allows symbolic events to ripple through the psyche.

---

### **2. Symbolic Memory Engine**

**File:** `symbolic_memory_engine.py`
Stores and retrieves **symbol-level memories**, distinct from episodic or emotional memory.

Tracks:

* meaning clusters
* archetypal traces
* symbolic motifs
* structural or recursive impressions

This enables characters to remember *meaning itself*, not just events.

---

### **3. Symbolic Perception Engine**

**File:** `symbolic_perception_engine.py`
Handles the interpretation of:

* symbolic cues
* archetypal markers
* narrative structures
* mythic or structural motifs

Acts as the perceptual front-end for symbolic reasoning.

---

### **4. Symbolic Self-Awareness**

**File:** `symbolic_self_awareness.py`
Produces a symbolic model of **the self**.

Includes:

* internal symbolic mirrors
* recursive identity references
* symbolic categorization of self-state
* shifting symbolic self-positions

This is one step below AGI-level recursive identity modeling.

---

### **5. Symbolic Step Logging**

**File:** `symbolic_step_log.py`
Records the internal cognitive process:

* meaning interpretations
* symbolic operations
* internal narrative steps
* symbolic decision traces

Useful for:

* debugging
* agent transparency
* cognitive auditing

---

### **6. Symbolic Trait Emergence**

**File:** `symbolic_trait_emergence.py`
Allows new traits to **form**, **evolve**, or **mutate** based on symbolic conditions.

This is one of your system’s most advanced evolutionary mechanisms, enabling:

* trait birth from symbolic resonance
* symbolic reinforcement of existing traits
* mutation cycles driven by symbolic events

This gives characters the ability to grow symbolically over time.

---

## Execution and Packaging Files

All necessary for testing and integration:

* `loader.py`
* `harness.py`
* `full_run.py`
* `demo.py`
* `demo_init.py`
* `__init__.py`

Works seamlessly with the root `run_all.py` orchestrator.

## Interaction With Other Bundles

This bundle sits at the crossroads of several domains:

* **character_symbolic** — provides raw symbolic meaning inputs
* **character_memory** — integrates symbolic impressions into memory systems
* **character_psychodynamics** — affects symbolic reasoning through emotion/affect
* **character_intent** — symbolic cognition influences goal formation
* **character_agi** — symbolic self-awareness feeds recursive self-models

It is one of the most critical bridges in your architecture.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

* emergent symbolic reasoning systems
* mythic logic engines
* recursive or self-aware symbolic agents
* narrative AI that interprets meaning structurally
* cognitive evolution simulations

## Summary

The **character_symbolic_cognition** bundle gives characters:

* diffusion of symbolic meaning
* symbolic perception
* symbolic memory
* symbolic self-awareness
* symbolic reasoning trails
* symbolic-driven trait emergence

This is the conceptual cortex of the character system—where meaning turns into cognition, and cognition evolves into identity.
