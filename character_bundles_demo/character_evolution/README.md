# character_evolution — README

## Purpose

The **character_evolution** bundle governs how characters grow, adapt, and transform over time. These modules provide:

* dynamic evolution of traits
* long‑arc narrative progression
* environmental and world‑driven growth hooks
* autonomous self‑modification cycles

This bundle enables characters to become **increasingly complex, adaptive agents** whose capabilities evolve in response to story, world pressure, and accumulated experience.

# Included Capabilities

### **1. Evolution Engine (`auto_evolution.py`)**

Coordinates the full evolution cycle:

* evaluates internal and external triggers
* applies mutation or refinement of traits
* schedules character growth events
* manages evolution pacing over long arcs

### **2. Narrative Arc Engine (`narrative_arc_engine.py`)**

Implements long‑term story‑driven transformation:

* arc milestones
* symbolic thresholds
* narrative‑based adaptations
* ability progression linked to character purpose

### **3. World Trait Hooks (`trait_world_hooks.py`)**

Connects character evolution to the world:

* reacts to world‑state changes
* syncs events across zones and timelines
* creates feedback loops between character traits and world systems

### **4. Tooling & Execution Scripts**

These scripts support development, testing, and integration:

* **loader.py** — Loads the full evolution bundle and prepares dependencies.
* **harness.py** — Minimal controlled environment for triggering evolution cycles.
* **demo_init.py** — Initializes a clean demo state.
* **demo.py** — Runs a simplified example of character evolution.
* **full_run.py** — Executes the complete evolution cycle with all systems active.
* **__init__.py** — Marks the folder as a module for import.

# Ideal Use Cases

* Characters who grow across chapters, campaigns, or seasons
* Systems with symbolic or narrative transformation
* AI research requiring autonomous adaptive agents
* Simulations where characters respond to environmental pressures
* Long‑term storytelling with emergent character change

---

# Integration Notes

The **character_evolution** bundle is most powerful when combined with:

* **character_memory** (to store long‑term developmental history)
* **character_intent** (to guide growth direction)
* **psychodynamics** (for motivation‑driven evolution)
* **symbolic & cognition bundles** (for high‑tier transformations)

It can also be licensed independently as a standalone evolution system.
