# CHARACTER BRANCH — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **Character Branch** defines the full cognitive, emotional, symbolic, and behavioral architecture for characters within the system. Each bundle represents a discrete layer of character function—ranging from core cognition to archetypal alignment, symbolic reasoning, memory formation, interaction logic, and recursive evolution.

This branch supports:

* Multi-layered psychological depth
* Symbolic and emotional modeling
* Long‑form developmental arcs
* Autonomous decision-making
* Modular licensing and integration across systems

The Character Branch is designed for use in simulations, games, narrative engines, symbolic AI research, and any environment where characters must evolve, interact, and generate meaning.

## 3. Purpose of the Character Branch

This branch expresses characters as:

* Cognitive agents
* Emotional organisms
* Symbolic interpreters
* Recursive and evolving beings
* Participants in narrative structure

It abstracts character identity into distinct symbolic, psychological, and behavioral layers.

---

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

The Character Branch provides:

### **Cognitive Architecture**

* Intent formation
* Belief processing
* Self-modeling
* Symbolic reasoning

### **Emotional & Psychodynamic Systems**

* Affect modeling
* Drives and activation levels
* Archetypal overlays
* Shadow and unconscious functions

### **Symbolic and Narrative Functions**

* Symbol mapping
* Prophecy and destiny frameworks
* Long-form character arcs

### **Interaction & Social Engines**

* Relationship networks
* Social dynamics
* Multi-character interplay

### **Evolution & Recursion**

* Adaptive growth
* Recursive identity shifts
* Development across narrative time

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

The Character Branch is designed to interface smoothly with:

* **World Branch** (environmental stimuli, context)
* **Item Branch** (symbolic tools, artifacts, influences)
* **Narrative Branch** (arcs, beats, prophecies)
* **Symbolic Branch** (recursive meaning systems)

Characters evolve through continuous feedback across these domains.

## 6. Running the Character Branch

Each bundle includes:

* `loader.py` — loads character modules and configurations
* `harness.py` — executes core functions for testing
* `full_run.py` — performs complete lifecycle evaluations
* `demo.py` — example usage and minimal scenarios
* `demo_init.py` — initializes demo state

The **root branch folder** includes:

* `run_all.py` — executes all bundle harnesses sequentially

---

## 7. Licensing

This branch and all included bundles are provided **as-is**.
All commercial, research, or redistributive use requires written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* AI simulation environments
* Advanced character systems for games
* Symbolic AI and cognition research
* Narrative generation and storytelling engines
* Psychological modeling
* Systems requiring multi-layered character depth

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

These modules are designed for constructive, creative, and experimental purposes.
They should not be used in applications intended to manipulate, deceive, or psychologically profile real individuals.
