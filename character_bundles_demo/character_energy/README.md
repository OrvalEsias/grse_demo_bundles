# CHARACTER_EVOLUTION — README.md

## 1. Overview

The **character_evolution** bundle defines the mechanisms through which characters transform over time. Evolution can occur through:

* symbolic thresholds
* psychological pressure
* narrative progression
* environmental influence
* trait/world interaction

This bundle handles both **automatic evolution cycles** and **story-driven transformation arcs**, allowing characters to grow, fracture, change internally, or realign with new identities.

It is the system responsible for long-arc development and metamorphosis across a character’s lifespan.

## 3. Purpose of This Bundle

The **character_evolution** bundle defines how characters transition from one psychological, symbolic, or narrative state to another. It governs:

* identity shifts
* growth and decay patterns
* transformation thresholds
* trait modification and symbolic realignment
* world-linked evolution conditions

This system ensures characters do not remain static but instead change meaningfully through simulation or story.

---

## 4. Capabilities / Responsibilities

### **Automatic Evolution Cycles**

* Characters evolve based on internal and external pressures
* Symbolic density, emotional states, and environmental energy all contribute

### **Narrative Arc Modeling**

* Characters progress through milestones and arcs
* Respond to story triggers
* Undergo metamorphoses based on narrative context

### **Trait–World Integration**

* World events modify traits
* Traits influence world response
* Bidirectional symbolic linkage

### **Transformation Thresholds**

* Detect when a character crosses into a new mode of being
* Apply systematic structural updates

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Bundles

The evolution system interacts directly with:

* **character_cognition_and_traits** → trait changes influence evolution
* **character_energy** → energetic thresholds trigger transformations
* **character_psychodynamics** → unconscious drives shape evolution paths
* **character_archetypes** → archetypal pressure drives metamorphosis

It is a central part of long-form behavioral and symbolic development.

---

## 6. Running This Bundle

Execution tools include:

* `loader.py` — initializes evolution systems
* `harness.py` — controlled testing
* `full_run.py` — runs full evolution cycles
* `demo.py` and `demo_init.py` — minimal examples of triggers and outcomes

Compatible with the root-level `run_all.py` orchestrator.

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Long-form character development
* Symbolic or mythological transformation arcs
* Narrative AI evolution

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

This bundle must be used only within simulated or creative environments.
Never apply evolution modeling to real persons or infer real psychological trajectories.
