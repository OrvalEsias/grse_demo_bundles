Five Tiny Symbolic System Demos (No ML, No Prompts, No Branching Trees)

Body

I’m sharing a small set of five lightweight Python demos that illustrate symbolic, state-driven processing without machine learning, prompt engineering, or decision trees.

These are educational demos, not a full engine. Each file is short, readable, dependency-light, and runnable from the terminal.

What they show:

How symbolic interpretation can be derived from structure, not intent

How internal state can evolve over time without branching logic

How “input” can be treated as perceived data, not instructions

How the same logic works in CLI or UI form

What they are not:

Not LLMs

Not generative text systems

Not chatbots

Not proprietary code

Included demos

A single symbolic update step (CLI + Gradio UI)

A minimal stateful symbolic engine

A numeric perception → symbol pipeline

A text perception → feature → symbol → interpretation pipeline

For the perception demo, input can be a phrase, sentence, or paragraph — the system interprets structural features rather than following instructions.

All demos are:

Free

Public

Safe to share
