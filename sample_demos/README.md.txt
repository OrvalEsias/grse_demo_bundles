# ERBE Sample Demo Modules

*A public, safe, lightweight demonstration set*

This folder contains **five small, self-contained demonstration modules** taken from simplified concepts inside the broader ERBE System. These demos contain **no proprietary logic** and are safe to publish, share, or include in public repositories.

Their purpose is to help developers understand:

* How symbolic updates work in a minimal form
* How simple perceptual → symbolic pipelines operate
* How a small engine maintains and updates state
* How ERBE-style processing can be visualized or tested
* The difference between UI demos and CLI demos

These demos are intended for **education, experimentation, and architectural illustration**.

#  Included Demo Modules

## **1. erbe_demo_app.py**

A Gradio-based UI demonstration of a symbolic update step.

## **2. erbe_step_demo.py**

A command-line version of the same tiny symbolic step.

## **3. mini_symbolic_engine.py**

A small symbolic engine with internal state (`energy`, `clarity`).

## **4. perceptual_constructor.py**

A simple ingest → symbolize pipeline for numeric perceptual signals.

## **5. perceptual_constructs_engine.py**

A text-based perception demo that outputs features, a symbol, and an interpretation.

#  What These Demos Are (and Are Not)

###  They ARE:

* Educational examples
* Architectural illustrations
* Tiny symbolic pipelines
* Safe to share publicly
* Free to bundle with documentation
* Free to use in instructional material

### They are NOT:

* Part of the real ERBE engine
* Proprietary recursion or cognition algorithms
* Commercial-grade modules
* Sensitive or high-value code

# Intended Uses

These demo files are suitable for:

* Teaching AI concepts
* Showing symbolic update mechanics
* Demonstrating perceptual abstraction
* Lightweight experiments or prototypes
* GitHub public examples
* Simple UI demos (e.g., Gradio)

# Licensing

These demos use the **ERBE Sample Demo License**, which allows:

* Free use
* Free modification
* Free redistribution (with license included)
* Educational and commercial integration

While restricting:

* Claiming the demos represent the full ERBE System
* Removing attribution
* Selling the demos as standalone products
