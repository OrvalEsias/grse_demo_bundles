# agency/ — README

## Purpose

The **agency** bundle governs autonomous world-level forces and influences that operate independently of characters. These forces express symbolic pressures, environmental intentions, distributed motives, and large-scale behavioral dynamics across the simulated world.

## Included Concepts

* World-level agents (non-character)
* Environmental intent modeling
* Autonomous symbolic behaviors
* Distributed influence mapping
* Abstract forces expressed through world-state changes

## Integration

* Feeds world motives into **core_world** during each world tick
* Interacts with **arcs** when narrative-scale pressures shift
* Influences density, resonance, and symbolic forces through **symbolic_physics**
* Drives or modifies zone behavior within **zone_sim**

## Typical Use Cases

* Simulation of large-scale environmental AI
* Distributed symbolic reasoning systems
* Non-character world agents shaping gameplay or narrative
