# zone_sim/ — README

## Purpose

The **zone_sim** bundle governs the simulation of individual zones or regions within the world. Each zone is treated as a semi-autonomous micro-environment with its own symbolic behavior, local recursion loops, density and resonance patterns, and environmental responses.

This bundle provides the framework for **localized simulation**, allowing the world to express detailed, emergent behavior at the regional scale.

## Included Concepts

* Zone-level update cycles
* Local symbolic physics (density, resonance, noise, mirror effects)
* Local recursion and micro-evolution
* Environmental triggers and localized anomalies
* Cross-zone boundary behavior and symbolic transitions
* Zone state storage and retrieval

## Integration

* Derives symbolic rules and parameters from **symbolic_physics**
* Receives world-state context and directives from **core_world**
* Applies local effects defined in **effects**
* Influenced by forces originating from **agency** and long-term patterns from **arcs**
* Feeds updated zone-state information into world evolution processes

## Typical Use Cases

* Region-based simulation in large worlds
* Environmental AI and procedural behaviors
* Localized symbolic storytelling
* Distinct environmental behaviors per zone
* Multi-zone worlds with heterogeneous behavior patterns
