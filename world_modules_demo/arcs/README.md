# arcs/ — README

## Purpose

The **arcs** bundle defines large-scale world arcs that influence the direction, character, or energetic state of the world over time. These arcs may represent narrative epochs, symbolic seasons, world-motifs, long-form transformations, or structural shifts that guide how the environment evolves.

## Included Concepts

* World-scale narrative or energetic arcs
* Long-term symbolic phase changes
* Macro-level environmental trends
* Global pressure systems that influence zones and regions
* Symbolic or thematic transitions across the world

## Integration

* Works with **core_world** to apply arc-based modifications during each update cycle
* Influences world evolution processes in **evolution**
* Coordinates with **symbolic_physics** to create symbolic or energetic shifts
* Guides environmental expression across regions simulated by **zone_sim**
* Can be shaped by, or shape, autonomous forces defined in **agency**

## Typical Use Cases

* Defining narrative epochs or eras
* Structuring long-term symbolic or energetic world changes
* Providing environmental context for character or narrative systems
* Shaping how regions transition through different states
