# effects/ — README

## Purpose

The **effects** bundle governs localized or regional phenomena within the world. These effects represent micro-scale symbolic events, environmental anomalies, weather-like behaviors, resonance surges, or any state changes that occur within a specific zone or cluster of zones.

Effects allow the world to express dynamic, moment-to-moment variation independent of global systems, providing texture, unpredictability, and symbolic nuance.

## Included Concepts

* Local symbolic phenomena
* Ambient or dynamic environmental effects
* Weather-like or elemental shifts
* Resonance spikes and symbolic pulses
* Micro-anomalies or localized distortions

## Integration

* Triggered or influenced by **core_world** during the world update cycle
* Parameterized or scaled according to **symbolic_physics** rules (density, resonance, noise, mirrors)
* Applied directly to regions handled by **zone_sim**
* May be influenced by world-scale pressures emerging from **agency** or **arcs**

## Typical Use Cases

* Dynamic weather or elemental changes
* Magical or symbolic disturbances
* Localized gameplay variation or environmental storytelling
* Emergent environmental behavior based on symbolic densities
