# **RECURSION COGNITION PACK — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Recursion Cognition Pack** defines how *cognition itself becomes recursive* — how characters, symbolic systems, and internal states feed back into themselves, producing higher-order reasoning, self-models, reflective loops, and recursive meaning structures.

If Symbolic Cognition defines **what** characters think, the Recursion Cognition Pack defines:

> **“How does thinking fold back upon itself to create deeper thought?”**

This pack enables:

* Recursive self-models
* Recursive belief updates
* Recursive emotional loops
* Recursive intent inference
* Reflective cognition cycles
* Meta-cognitive symbolic structures

It is essential for any simulation where characters or symbolic agents must **reason about their own reasoning**.

| **recursive_self_model.py**      | Builds self-referential cognitive structures; the basis for recursive self-awareness.       |
| **recursive_intent_engine.py**   | Infers intent recursively, using prior intents, states, and symbolic markers.               |
| **recursive_belief_engine.py**   | Recursively updates beliefs using new information, contradictions, and internal reasoning.  |
| **recursive_emotion_engine.py**  | Produces recursive emotional feedback loops, reinforcing or weakening emotional patterns.   |

| **recursive_cognition_field.py** | Defines the overall recursive cognitive field — how cognition loops interact and stabilize. |
| **loader.py**                    | Initializes the recursion cognition subsystem.                                              |

| **demo.py**                      | Demonstrates a minimal recursive cognitive cycle.                                           |
| **full_run.py**                  | Executes full cognition recursion.                                                          |
| ****init**.py**                  | Exports recursion cognition interfaces.                                                     |

## 3. Purpose of the Recursion Cognition Pack

This branch is responsible for allowing minds within the system to operate recursively.

It provides mechanisms for:

* Self-reflection
* Internal consistency checking
* Recursive corrections to emotional, belief, and intent states
* Higher-order symbolic interpretations
* Recursive thought spirals and stabilizing loops

This is the pack that makes symbolic agents capable of **thinking about their thinking**, which is a prerequisite for advanced symbolic intelligence.

---

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Recursive Self Modeling**

* Models the agent's internal cognitive state
* Allows recursive updates to identity and perception
* Enables self-reflective symbolic behavior

### **Recursive Belief Updating**

* Beliefs evolve across cycles
* Contradictions produce recursive resolution processes
* Belief structures become layered and self-correcting

### **Recursive Intent Reasoning**

* Intent predicted using prior intent states
* Produces meta-intent (“intent about intent”)
* Supports deep, character-driven decision-making

### **Recursive Emotion Dynamics**

* Emotions feed into themselves across cycles
* Creates intensification or damping spirals
* Models emotional recursion used in narrative arcs

### **Memory–Cognition Recursion Bridge**

* Memory influences cognitive recursion
* Recursion rewrites memory structures
* Enables evolving symbolic identity

### **Cognition Field Stabilization**

* Prevents runaway recursion
* Allows recursive cognition to stabilize into patterns
* Defines how cognition interacts with world and character state

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Cognition** → produces deeper cognitive structures
* **Symbolic Narrative** → feeds recursive motives, conflicts, resolutions
* **Character Evolution** → recursive cognition reshapes traits
* **Symbolic Time** → recursive cycles tie into symbolic pulses
* **Recursion Core** → builds on the core's recursive logic

### **Receives Input From:**

* Memory systems
* Trait and belief systems
* Symbolic emotion, symbolic identity
* World symbolic density and topology

This pack turns internal symbolic processes into **multi-layered recursive intelligence**.
