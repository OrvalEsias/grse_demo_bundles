# **RECURSION CORE PACK — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Recursion Core Pack** defines the foundational mechanics of recursive behavior in the Erbe Symbolic Engine. While other branches describe symbolic physics, cognition, narrative, or time, this branch answers a deeper structural question:

> **“How does meaning fold back onto itself to create higher-order structure?”**

The Recursion Core implements:

* Base-level recursive logic
* Symbolic inference loops
* Recursive event routing
* Recursion scheduling
* Energy-based recursion amplification
* State export for multi-branch recursive interaction

This pack is the **root engine** that allows symbols, actions, characters, and world states to recursively inform, transform, and reshape each other.

## 3. Purpose of the Recursion Core

The Recursion Core is responsible for the most fundamental capability of the system:

> **Self-referential symbolic evolution.**

This branch allows symbolic states to:

* Turn back upon themselves
* Gain meta-structure
* Reinforce or disrupt earlier symbolic patterns
* Scale from simple symbolic associations to multi-layered symbolic architectures

It enables:

* Self-reflective characters
* Recursively generated narratives
* World states that evolve through feedback loops
* Symbolic cognition that builds on its own outputs
* Multi-branch symbolic harmonization

Without the Recursion Core, all other symbolic layers remain **flat**. With it, they become **alive**.

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Recursive Logic Binding**

* Forms chains of meaning across cycles
* Preserves symbolic continuity
* Establishes deep structural links

### **Symbolic Mapping**

* Maps symbolic states across recursion depth
* Tracks shifts and transformations
* Ensures correct referential behavior

### **Recursive Inference**

* Generates new symbolic meaning from prior states
* Evaluates recursive contexts
* Powers emergent symbolic reasoning

### **Recursion Scheduling**

* Controls depth, frequency, phases
* Prevents infinite recursion
* Allows controlled recursive amplification

### **Energy-Driven Recursion**

* Uses symbolic energy (Symbolic Energy Pack) to decide:

  * whether recursion activates
  * how strong recursive effects become
  * when recursion collapses or stabilizes

### **Event Routing**

* Ensures events propagate recursively across systems
* Bridges recursion with narrative, cognition, and world branches

### **State Export**

* Provides cross-branch compatibility
* Enables external systems to read recursive structure

## 5. Interaction With Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Cognition** → recursive thought, symbolic reinterpretation
* **Symbolic Narrative** → recursive arc shaping, mythic loops
* **Symbolic Time** → recurring cycles and time crystals
* **Symbolic Energy** → recursion amplification or collapse
* **Character Evolution** → recursive trait development
* **World Branch** → recursive environmental harmonics

### **Receives Input From:**

* Symbolic Energy levels
* Character states
* World density maps
* Memory logs
* Trait evolution

The Recursion Core is the **central feedback mechanism** connecting all symbolic subsystems.
