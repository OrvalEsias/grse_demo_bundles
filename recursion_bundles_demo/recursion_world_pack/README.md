# **RECURSION WORLD PACK — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Recursion World Pack** defines how recursion operates on the **environmental, spatial, and world-structural level** of the Erbe Symbolic Engine.

If the Recursion Core Pack manages logic, and Recursion Cognition manages minds, the Recursion World Pack answers:

> **“How does the world itself become recursive?”**

This branch models:

* Environmental recursion loops
* Recursive zone density and symbolic harmonics
* World-state iteration through recursive passes
* Zone resonance cycles
* Recursive world flux (world-level symbolic shifts)
* Bidirectional recursion between characters and environment

This pack allows the world to acquire **its own recursive identity**, evolving in response to symbolic density, time, energy, and character interactions.

## 3. Purpose of the Recursion World Pack

The Recursion World Pack enables **environmental recursion**:

* Worlds evolve recursively, not linearly.
* Zones gain symbolic identity over time.
* Environmental patterns feed back into symbolic and narrative systems.
* Characters influence zones recursively, and zones recursively influence characters.

This branch transforms the world into a **self-updating symbolic organism**.

---

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Zone Resonance**

* Zones develop recursive symbolic harmonics
* Recurrence patterns amplify or diminish internal symbolic structure
* Defines environmental “mood” or symbolic climate

### **Environment Bridge**

* Connects world recursion to:

  * Character recursion
  * Item recursion
  * Symbolic Energy & Ecology
  * Symbolic Narrative
* Ensures cross-branch recursion flows smoothly

### **Worldstate Iterator**

* Applies recursive passes to the world state
* Allows the world to evolve in depth over time
* Generates world-level feedback loops

### **World Flux Engine**

* Computes environmental symbolic shifts
* Tracks world drift, flux, and transformational cycles
* Models large-scale symbolic transitions

### **Zone Density Tracker**

* Monitors recursive symbolic density at the zone level
* Informs narrative, ecology, and cognition branches
* Enables recursive world balancing

---

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Ecology** → zone-level recursion affects ecological density
* **Symbolic Narrative** → world shifts drive narrative events
* **Character Evolution** → characters respond to recursive zones
* **Symbolic Time** → recursion influences temporal behavior
* **Symbolic Energy** → world flux impacts energy fields

### **Receives Input From:**

* Recursion Core Pack
* Recursion Cognition Pack
* World’s baseline symbolic density
* Character and item symbolic markers

With this pack, recursion becomes **a property of the world itself**, not just minds or symbols.

## 6. Running the Recursion World Pack

### **Zone Resonance**

```python
from recursion_zone_resonance import update_zone_resonance
```

### **Environment Bridge**

```python
from recursion_environment_bridge import propagate_environment_recursion
```

### **Worldstate Iterator**

```python
from recursion_worldstate_iterator import iterate_worldstate
```

### **World Flux Engine**

```python
from recursion_world_flux_engine import calculate_world_flux
```

### **Density Tracking**

```python
from recursive_zone_density_tracker import update_zone_density
```

### **Demo & Harness**

* `demo.py` gives a minimal example
* `harness.py` tests recursive world mechanics
* `full_run.py` executes full multi-pass recursion

## 7. Licensing

This branch is provided **as-is**.
Commercial and research use requires explicit written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* World recursion systems for symbolic worlds
* Large-scale emergent world evolution
* Dynamic zone ecosystems
* Recursive environmental storytelling
* AGI research in environmental feedback
* Simulation engines for self-evolving worlds

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

Do **not** apply world recursion systems to real-world populations, demographics, environments, or predictive modeling of human groups.

This branch is for **symbolic simulation, storytelling, and research**, not real-world forecasting.
