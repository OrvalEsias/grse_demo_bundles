# **RECURSION STABILITY PACK — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Recursion Stability Pack** defines the stabilizing, regulating, and corrective mechanisms that keep recursive symbolic systems from collapsing, spiraling, or diverging uncontrollably.

If the Recursion Core enables recursion, and Recursion Cognition/World handle cognitive and environmental recursion, then the Recursion Stability Pack answers the essential question:

> **“How do we keep recursive systems stable, balanced, and coherent over time?”**

Recursive systems naturally tend toward:

* Runaway amplification
* Chaotic drift
* Infinite loops
* Feedback overload

This pack provides the *counter-balancing layer* that:

* Detects instability
* Dampens harmful recursion
* Reinforces constructive recursion
* Maintains long-term recursive coherence

It is essential for any simulation or symbolic engine intended to run for long periods or to model evolving symbolic universes.

## 3. Purpose of the Recursion Stability Pack

Recursive symbolic systems create emergent behavior — but emergent behavior can degrade into noise without regulation.

The Stability Pack ensures:

* Controlled recursion depth
* Predictable structure formation
* Prevention of fragmentation
* Preservation of symbolic identity
* Long-form simulation durability

It answers the structural need for a stable feedback engine that:

* Monitors symbolic drift
* Evaluates recursive coherence
* Applies stabilizing or dampening factors
* Ensures recursion remains **meaningful**, not chaotic

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Stability Engine**

* Monitors recursive activity across branches
* Rates symbolic stability levels
* Applies balancing corrections
* Prevents destabilizing feedback loops

### **Stabilization Field**

* Generates a symbolic stabilizing field
* Dampens excessive recursion
* Enhances weakened recursion
* Provides buffering for symbolic systems under strain

### **Drift Detection**

* Tracks divergence from symbolic identity
* Detects fragmentation or decay
* Identifies loss of symbolic coherence
* Flags unhealthy recursive states

### **Integrated Stabilization**

* Works with recursion core, cognition, world, and energy systems
* Ensures multi-branch recursive harmony
* Supports long-term recursive narrative or world simulation

## 5. Interaction with Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Recursion Core** → informs scheduler and inference engines
* **Symbolic Cognition** → stabilizes recursive thought loops
* **Symbolic Narrative** → prevents narrative collapse or runaway arcs
* **Symbolic Time** → stabilizes symbolic cycles and pulses
* **World Branch** → regulates recursive zone resonance

### **Receives Input From:**

* Drift signals from symbolic memory, traits, identity
* Energy levels (from Symbolic Energy)
* World density (from Symbolic Ecology)
* Recursive loops across all packs

This pack is the **fail-safe and balance layer** for the entire recursion subsystem.

## 6. Running the Recursion Stability Pack

### **Stability Engine**

```python
from recursion_stability_engine import evaluate_and_stabilize
```

### **Stabilization Field**

```python
from recursion_stabilization_field import apply_stabilization_field
```

### **Drift Detector**

```python
from recursion_drift_detector import detect_recursive_drift
```

### **Demo & Harness**

* `demo.py` shows minimal stabilization logic
* `harness.py` tests drift detection, stability, and regulation
* `full_run.py` executes full integrated stability cycle

## 7. Licensing

This branch is provided **as-is**.
Commercial, research, or redistributive use requires written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Long-running recursive symbolic simulations
* Narrative systems requiring stable multi-layer recursion
* AGI recursion research with controlled feedback
* Stabilizing symbolic identity in evolving agents
* Preventing drift in recursive world or cognition models

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

Do **not** apply recursive stability systems to:

* Behavioral or psychological manipulation
* Real-world prediction or influence systems
* Monitoring real individuals' cognitive drift

Use this pack responsibly to maintain **constructive recursion**, not to limit or manipulate human behavior.
