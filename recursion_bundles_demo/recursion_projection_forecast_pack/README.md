# **RECURSION PROJECTION & FORECAST PACK — README.md**

## 1. Overview

The **Recursion Projection & Forecast Pack** defines the predictive, analytical, and forward-modeling capabilities of the Erbe Symbolic Engine’s recursive subsystem.

Where other recursion packs handle logic, cognition, world behavior, and stability, this pack answers:

> **“Given current symbolic recursion states, what is likely to happen next?”**

This pack introduces:

* Recursive forecasting
* Symbolic trend projection
* Recurrence pattern analysis
* Future-state simulation
* Visualization of recursive trajectories

It is the analytical layer that transforms symbolic recursion into **predictive structure**, enabling simulations to anticipate symbolic events, narrative developments, or system-level transformations.

## 3. Purpose of the Recursion Forecast Pack

This branch transforms recursive systems from purely reactive into **predictive symbolic engines**.

It allows the simulation to:

* Anticipate symbolic drift
* Identify upcoming narrative or cognitive transitions
* Predict high-energy symbolic events
* Detect recursions approaching instability or critical thresholds
* Forecast long-range symbolic evolution

This pack is essential for systems that require **lookahead**, **anticipation**, or **predictive symbolic intelligence**.

## 4. Capabilities and Responsibilities

### **Recursive Projection Engine**

* Projects symbolic states across future cycles
* Uses energy, density, and topology patterns
* Models potential symbolic futures

### **Prediction Engine**

* Computes next-step symbolic predictions
* Scores likelihood of various symbolic transitions
* Identifies attractors, repellers, and symbolic tipping points

### **Recursion Visualizer**

* Generates structural visualizations of recursive trends
* Summarizes symbolic trajectories
* Helps diagnose upcoming narrative, emotional, or world shifts

### **Integrated Forecasting**

* Works with recursion stability, cognition, and world packs
* Provides predictive data to narrative and character engines
* Enables “foreshadowing” in symbolic narrative systems

---

## 5. Interaction With Other Branches

### **Feeds Into:**

* **Symbolic Narrative** → narrative foreshadowing and arc prediction
* **Character Branch** → predicted trait or emotional changes
* **Symbolic Cognition** → anticipation-driven reasoning
* **World Branch** → environmental shifts based on projected recursion
* **Recursion Stability Pack** → helps prevent instability before it occurs

### **Receives Input From:**

* Recursion Core logic
* Symbolic density and energy states
* World topology and zone resonance
* Memory and identity markers

This pack turns recursion into **a predictive and analytical tool**, not just a structural one.

## 6. Running the Recursion Forecast Pack

### **Projection**

```python
from recursive_projection_engine import project_recursive_state
```

### **Prediction**

```python
from recursion_prediction_engine import predict_symbolic_transition
```

### **Visualization**

```python
from recursion_visualizer import visualize_recursive_trajectory
```

### **Demo & Harness**

* `demo.py` demonstrates basic projection
* `harness.py` tests predictive stability and accuracy
* `full_run.py` executes the integrated forecast cycle

## 7. Licensing

This branch is provided **as-is**.
Commercial, research, or redistributive use requires written permission.

---

## 8. Intended Use Cases

* Predictive symbolic simulations
* AGI symbolic foresight research
* Narrative foreshadowing engines
* Character transformation forecasts
* World evolution prediction
* Recursive trend visualization tools

---

## 9. Ethical Use Guidance

Do **not** use symbolic forecast systems for:

* Real-world prediction of individuals or populations
* Psychological or behavioral manipulation
* Surveillance or influence modeling

Use this pack to explore **symbolic futures**, not real human ones.
