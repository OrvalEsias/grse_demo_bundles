# GRSE Demo Branch — README

## How GRSE Differs from Other Engines and AI Systems

GRSE is not a behavior tree system, not a simple simulation toolkit, and not a traditional narrative engine. It is a **unified cognitive architecture** that integrates six subsystems—Item, Character, World, Symbolic, Recursion, and Narrative—into a single coherent framework. This makes GRSE fundamentally different from:

* Game AI frameworks (which focus on behavior trees or GOAP)
* ECS/world simulators (which handle objects, not cognition)
* Story engines (which track plot, not internal state)
* LLM agent frameworks (which lack persistent traits, beliefs, and worlds)
* Symbolic AI systems (which do not integrate emotion, action, or environment)

### Key Differences

**1. Full Cognitive Stack** — GRSE models traits, beliefs, emotions, intent, symbolic meaning, recursive reasoning, and narrative positioning. No other engine includes all layers.

**2. Meaning-Based Behavior** — Instead of condition-action logic, GRSE agents interpret events symbolically, update beliefs/emotions, and act through evolving internal intentions.

**3. Modular Branch Architecture** — Each branch is independent and plug-and-play. GRSE can be used for LLM agents, simulations, games, narrative engines, or autonomous systems.

**4. Recursive Reasoning Engine** — GRSE includes a built-in feedback cycle enabling self-adjustment, reflection, and emergent behavior.

**5. Symbolic + Computational Hybrid** — GRSE blends symbolic meaning with computational systems, a rare hybrid enabling high-level conceptual reasoning.

**6. Designed for LLM-Augmented Agents** — GRSE provides persistence, identity, belief structures, and world context—elements missing from modern LLM agent frameworks.

**7. Unified System-Level Architecture** — GRSE spans items → characters → world → meaning → narrative, ensuring all layers of cognition and simulation remain synchronized.

## Generative Recursive Simulation Engine — Demo Bundles

The **Generative Recursive Simulation Engine (GRSE)** is a modular cognitive‑simulation framework composed of six major branches. This **demo branch** presents the full architecture, structure, and bundle layout of the live system—**without exposing proprietary logic**.

The demo includes:

* Clean structural stubs
* Loaders and placeholder scripts
* Documentation for each bundle
* A complete view of how the system fits together

Everything here is safe for public review and licensing.

# What GRSE Is

GRSE is a multi‑branch engine designed for:

* agent cognition
* world/environment modeling
* symbolic interpretation
* recursive reasoning
* narrative structuring
* item and resource logic

GRSE can be used for:

* LLM‑enhanced autonomous agents
* simulation characters
* dynamic game AI
* narrative generation
* multi‑agent emergent behavior
* symbolic AI research

The **demo version** mirrors the structure of the live engine.
The **live version** contains the full operational logic.

# The Six Branches and Their Bundles

Below are the **correct six branches** used in the GRSE live and demo repositories.

---

## 1. Item Branch

### Purpose

Manages all **objects, tools, and resources** an agent can interact with.

### Bundles Include

* **Item Core** — item definitions and metadata.
* **Item Interaction** — pick‑up, use, combine, activate.
* **Item Effects** — modifies character, world, or symbolic state.
* **Item Evolution** — upgrades, cooldowns, transformations.

### Applications

* tool selection for agentic systems
* simulation resource logic
* inventory mechanics for games
* LLM tool‑use modules

---

## 2. Character Branch

### Purpose

Defines the **internal cognitive, emotional, and behavioral systems** of agents.

### Bundles Include

* **Trait/Feature Engine** — personality variables and stats.
* **Emotion/Affect Engine** — emotional context and modulation.
* **Belief/Memory Engine** — stored knowledge and assumptions.
* **Intent/Action Engine** — decision-making and next-step logic.
* **Identity/Persona Engine** — long‑term personality and behavior profiles.

### Applications

* persistent LLM personalities
* autonomous agents with evolving internal state
* NPC behavioral systems
* multi‑agent research frameworks

---

## 3. World Branch

### Purpose

Models the **environment** agents inhabit and respond to.

### Bundles Include

* **World Core** — base representation of world state.
* **Zone System** — regions, areas, or world sectors.
* **World Update Engine** — environmental changes and world progression.
* **Interaction Mapping** — how actions modify world state.

### Applications

* simulations & training environments
* digital twins
* dynamic open world games
* multi‑agent coordination

---

## 4. Symbolic Branch

### Purpose

Handles **symbolic meaning, patterns, metaphors, and conceptual interpretation**.

### Bundles Include

* **Symbolic Core** — symbolic state representation.
* **Meaning & Pattern Engine** — detects conceptual or thematic links.
* **Symbolic Influence Engine** — applies symbolic states to world or agent behavior.

### Applications

* narrative engines
* symbolic reasoning research
* thematic/semantic LLM augmentation
* agents responding to conceptual triggers

---

## 5. Recursion Branch

### Purpose

Controls **feedback loops, iterative reasoning, and state update cycles**.

### Bundles Include

* **Recursion Core** — the main cognitive update cycle.
* **Feedback Cycle Engine** — internal chain reactions between states.
* **Recursive Growth/Decay** — long‑term strengthening or decay of traits or conditions.

### Applications

* reflective agentic LLMs (ReAct, ToT, reflection)
* adaptive NPCs
* self‑correcting autonomous agents
* complex simulations with evolving actors

---

## 6. Narrative Branch

### Purpose

Defines **story logic, plot beats, arcs, and narrative state progression**.

### Bundles Include

* **Narrative Core** — basic arc and beat tracking.
* **Event Mapper** — converts actions into narrative events.
* **Arc Evolution Engine** — manages long‑term narrative progression.

### Applications

* AI story generation
* narrative‑based simulations
* emergent storytelling from complex systems
* summarizing simulation logs into readable narratives

# Summary

**GRSE consists of six fully modular branches—Item, Character, World, Symbolic, Recursion, and Narrative—each containing structural bundles that define a subsystem of cognition, simulation, or narrative logic.**

The **demo branch** shows the complete structural architecture.
The **live branch** contains the full functional engine and is governed by separate commercial licensing.

This README is suitable for public GitHub release and licensing review.
